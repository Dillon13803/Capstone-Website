      <h1>Modern Day Social Responsibility</h1>

      <h2>Protecting Stakeholders from Harm</h2>
      <p>
        Our core social responsibility in IT is to ensure ethical choices, as unethical data practices can harm customers and other companies dependent on our services. This is the same stance that UpGuard holds as well. According to UpGuard (Chin, 2025), “it is crucial for public safety and well-being, as well as helping to ensure the longevity of businesses” (para. 3). This then impacts their employees and their families, showing the importance of making ethical choices. This is similar to the importance that Marymount University stated: “The ethical issues in information technology will impact individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.” Responsible data usage is essential for maintaining a company's legal standing, professional integrity, and public trust. Handling ethical issues in the appropriate way may make all the difference between a company staying afloat or individuals avoiding legal repercussions for criminal activity. Ultimately, it is everyone’s job to educate themselves on ethical issues and how to handle them to protect both company assets and personnel.

      <h2>Proactive Safeguards and Monitoring</h2>
      <p>
        Companies can proactively start implementing technical safeguards as a responsibility to their clients and the public. These safeguards, such as rules that screen for specific data types or patterns, help capture and stop potential incidents before they occur. This proactive approach supports continuous monitoring and provides an immediate line of defense against both malicious and accidental breaches. Furthermore, we will work toward deploying our own secure, internal instance of a large language model, which will allow us to isolate and strictly control the sensitive information we introduce to the AI tool. </p>

      <h2>Education and Client Engagement</h2>
      <p>
        A key preventive measure against ethical data mishandling is continuous education. Our commitment to social responsibility includes emphasizing the importance of proper data handling to our teammates and clients, ensuring they understand that any data input into a public service like ChatGPT is essentially exposed to the public domain. This dedication includes comprehensive training for both our project team and any client individuals connected to the capstone.</p>
