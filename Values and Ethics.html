      <h1>Modern Day Values and Ethics: Data Usage</h1>

      <h2>The Critical Ethical Framework</h2>
      <p>
        The critical ethical issue we are focusing on is Data Usage Ethics, which is something that all IT professionals must be aware of and adhere to regarding data compliance. According to Harvard Business School Online (Côté, 2021), “Data ethics encompasses the moral obligations of gathering, protecting, and using personally identifiable information and how it affects individuals” (para. 1). This stresses that it is everyone’s job to follow data ethics in the field. Making the correct ethical choices can be the difference between a company avoiding serious legal trouble and suffering loss of reputation and revenue. Responsible data usage is essential for maintaining a company's legal standing, professional integrity, and public trust.</p>

      <h3>High-Stakes Violations and Consequences</h3>
      <p>
        Improper data handling and unauthorized use can cause negative consequences that escalate quickly. An example of a high-stakes risk involves placing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) into unapproved data storage locations or public AI tools such as ChatGPT. A significant modern challenge is inputting a company's proprietary code directly into a public AI tool. According to Bitdefender (Constantinescu, 2025), “A series of startling discoveries have revealed that some conversations shared via ChatGPT’s ‘Share’ feature have been indexed by Google, putting sensitive user information in the public domain” (para. 2). This highlights the risk of placing sensitive company data, including intellectual property (IP), into public third-party systems, potentially violating NDAs and data-compliance rules, and exposing the company to reputational damage and financial penalties.</p>

      <h3>Case Study: Samsung's Confidential Code Leak</h3>
      <p>
      Samsung publicly experienced the issue of employees entering sensitive data into public AI tools. Several workers uploaded the company’s confidential source code, risking exposure of highly sensitive intellectual property. While employees often acted without malicious intent—seeking quick fixes or optimization—the incident demonstrated how pressure and expediency can lead to ethical lapses. In response, Samsung banned employees from using generative AI services, and many organizations are now investing in internal AI solutions to mitigate such risks (Glover, 2023).

      <h3>Professional Values: Preventing Data Misuse</h3>
      <p>
        In todays world, we must remain vigilant about these modern ethical issues and embrace our responsibility to prevent mishandling of proprietary data. A primary mitigation method is strict data hygiene before information enters any AI tool: check project data for sensitive business details and PII, and, when needed, replace real data with fictionalized placeholders. These practices protect clients and their customers and help maintain data compliance.</p>
